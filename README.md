# Orchestating Ping-Pong Service
Learning CNCF

## The Plan
So the plan is to develop a simple ping-pong REST service that can be deployed to a kubernetes cluster using helm charts. The service will respond to ping requests with pong responses.

We will explore the following CNCF projects:
- Kubernetes
- Helm
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- GitHub Actions
- Docker
- container registry (Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, etc.)
- Terraform (optional)
- ArgoCD (optional)
- KinD (Kubernetes in Docker)

The project will be built on golang for the REST service.
